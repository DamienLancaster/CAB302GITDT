/**
 * A class for managing a container ship's cargo manifest.  It
 * allows freight containers of various types to be loaded and
 * unloaded, within various constraints.
 * <p>
 * In particular, the ship's captain has set the following rules
 * for loading of new containers:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * New containers may be loaded only if doing so does not exceed
 * the ship's weight limit.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * New containers are to be loaded as close to the bridge as possible.
 * (Stack number zero is nearest the bridge.)
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * A new container may be added to a stack only if doing so will
 * not exceed the maximum allowed stack height.
 * <li>
 * A new container may be loaded only if a container with the same
 * code is not already on board.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Stacks of containers must be homogeneous, i.e., each stack must
 * consist of containers of one type (general,
 * refrigerated or dangerous goods) only.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, since the containers are moved by an overhead
 * crane, a container can be unloaded only if it is on top of
 * a stack.
